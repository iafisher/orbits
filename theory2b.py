MODEL 2B of the SOLAR SYSTEM

Same as Model 1, except that

- Earth's axis of rotation tilts 23.4Â° away from the perpendicular of the ecliptic.
- The North and South Poles are the points where the axis of rotation intersects Earth's
  surface, and not the points on Earth's surface farthest from the ecliptic.
